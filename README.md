# Security Audit

## Scenario

This scenario is based on a fictitious company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. company that develops and sells toys. The company has only one physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers from the United States and abroad. Its information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support its online marketplace worldwide. 

The IT department manager has decided that an internal IT audit is needed. She expresses concern that she does not have a consolidated action plan to ensure business continuity and regulatory compliance as the company grows. She believes that an internal audit can help better secure the company's infrastructure and help identify and mitigate potential risks, threats or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring they are compliant with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (EU).

The IT manager begins by applying the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), establishing an audit scope and objectives, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks the company might experience due to the current state of its security posture. The IT manager wants to use the results of the audit as evidence to gain approval to expand her department. 

## Objective
My objective is to review the IT manager's scope, objectives and risk assessment to conduct an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist.
